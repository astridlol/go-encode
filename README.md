# go-encode

a very, very basic API written in Go to encrypt and decrypt strings using base64.
<br>
I just started learning go, and figured I should upload some progress along the way.

## API Reference

#### Encode string

```http
  GET /encode?string=hey
```


#### Decode string

```http
  GET  /decode?string=bG9s
```
